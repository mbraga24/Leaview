#### Web Application Description

This web application is a customer review app that would assist Tiffany & Co. to gather data on customers by asking for their review on the sales associate who assisted them and give them the option of leaving a feedback to the store.

The focus of this idea was to have on the customer's receipt a code/barcode that would be used by a device (a bar code scanner) attached to an ipad/tablet. This barcode scanner would scan the code/barcode on the customer's receipt retrieving from the company's database the picture of the sales associate related to that code/barcode on the receipt. The sales associate image would then be displayed on the screen
