#### Web Application Description

This web application is a customer review app that would assist Tiffany & Co. to gather data on customers by asking for their review on the sales associate who assisted them and give them the option of leaving a feedback to the store.

The focus of this idea was to have on the customer's receipt a code/barcode that would be used by a device (a bar code scanner) attached to an ipad/tablet. This barcode scanner would scan the code/barcode on the customer's receipt retrieving from the company's database the picture of the sales associate related to that code/barcode on the receipt. The sales associate image would then be displayed on the screen prompting the client whether that was the sales associate who assisted them or not, they would confirm and be taken to the next step where the evaluation would appear. A 5 stars rating system would show up on the screen asking customers to leave a 1 to 5 stars rating to that sales associate who assisted them. They would then be taken to a "Thank you for shopping at Tiffany & Co." screen or anything related. 

Between the 5 stars rating and the final "Thank you" message however, another option could be added to the app to allow customers to leave their feedback. A message would pop up on the screen along with a text box to allow sales associate to leave their general feedback about the store. This process could be done in two ways: either by turning the ipad/tablet landscape mode allowing customers to type their own review or a more effective and less time consuming way would be implementing a voice-controlled technology that would allow customers to speak in any language and have their feedback written right away on the screen by the voice-controlled. This voice controlled technology is found in devices such as the Amazon Echo, where you interact with the personal assistant "Alexia".

Instead of the use of an external device for the scanning process, another solution could also be the use of a camera device either also external or internal form the ipad/tablet device. This way keeping it all in one device.

In terms of backend, the database where the photos and the sales associate's name would be retrieved to display on the device would be connected to another database where their evaluation/average points would be stored to futher analysis of their performance based on the reviews collected by customers. The general store feedback would also be stored in another database for future analysis. 

Another interesting idea to implement on this application: every customer is requested to fill out a form when they make a purchase. They fill this form with name, country, address, etc... this data could be stored on the company's database as has always been (or implement a new database to accompanied the others) and through the creation of a relationship between all or some of the databases, right upon code/barcode reading the app could dynamically change the language of the questions that will be asked to the customers based on the form they have previously filled. This way will facilitate the delivery of what it's expected from them. Improving communication and broadening the reviews.

This is could be described as userfriendly metrics management system. Thus collecting precious information on customers feedback and staff performance. It will also increase engagement of brand ambassadors with customers.
